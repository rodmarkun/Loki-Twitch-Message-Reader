# Loki-Twitch-Message-Reader
Loki is a very simple script made in python to read Twitch Chat messages in real time and write them down in a file. In this version it only writes the last message sent, but feel free to modify its behaviour as you want.

At first, loki was designed to read Twitch Chat messages and display them in a little cute cat in OBS, but it can be modified at will to be fully customized. If you're going to use it I'd appreciate crediting, thanks!
